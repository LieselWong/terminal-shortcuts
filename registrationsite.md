### Endpoints
To understand endpoints, we first need an API. An API is a way to connect and interact different software components. Oftentimes, the API is public. 
We can then use APIs to respond to client requests and send an appropriate response using the API functions that we code or the request given. 

An endpoint is what allows you to customize a request (for example searching for a particular term in the search bar, we have a bunch of search parameters or names in the search bar ex: https://github.com/LieselWong/terminal-shortcuts/edit/main/registrationsite.md) 

Some APIS require verification, hence we need an API key and we have to create an account with that website to get that API key
